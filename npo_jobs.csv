About Health Resources in Action and the LEAH Project:

The Leaders through Education, Action and Hope (LEAH) Project is a science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), college access, and career readiness program for Boston Public high school students who are typically underrepresented in STEM fields. (i.e. youth of color and first-generation youth). LEAH recruits and trains high school students, known as LEAH Mentors, to teach hands on STEM lessons and provide homework assistance to elementary school students in afterschool and summer programs throughout Boston. The LEAH Project aims to close the STEM achievement gap for youth underrepresented in STEM fields, increase their access to post-secondary education, and prepare them for the workforce by providing them with STEM teaching internships in after school and summer camp programs. 

The LEAH Project provides its high school LEAH Mentors with valuable work experience in STEM and education and mentorship in a near-peer model. 

The LEAH Project is an initiative of Health Resources in Action, Inc. (HRiA), a nonprofit public health organization based in Boston, Massachusetts. HRiA has a mission to help people live healthier lives and build healthier communities through prevention, health promotion, policy, and research. HRiA works with a diverse group of clients across the country to address some of the most critical public health issues using innovative and evidence-based approaches to improve population health, particularly in communities of color and with young people.  

Since its founding in 1957, HRiA has been at the forefront of public health, leading the way to promote healthier and more vibrant communities.  Our work recognizes the impact of social, economic, and racial factors on health outcomes.

The RC must act as a recovery liaison and support the assigned individual(s) in preparing for or accompanying them to meetings with, for example, probation officers, social workers, and child protection/child welfare workers.
The RC must assist assigned individual(s) in creating personally meaningful links to treatment, peer recovery support services, and mutually aid and support them in their efforts to build their capacity to move between and among these services and supports as need (e.g. ATS, residential programs, 12 Step Meetings, Sober Homes, etc.).

We are very interested in finding Companion/Home Helpers who enjoy older people, have experience dealing with elders, are pro-active in providing companionship and creating fun activities and outings for their elder client's enjoyment (your expenses are paid for by the client for outings) and are comfortable helping the older person by doing light housekeeping (meal prep, light housekeeping, laundry). 

We are in conversation with a several families and need additional staff to take these jobs when they become available. We usually do not have time to post the openings before we need to fill them. Please apply if interested in general in this type of work to get on our list. We have a great need for more staff and turn jobs away when we can't fill them. 

Many of our jobs are with elders with some typically mild memory issues and some experience with helping someone with memory problems in their family or at work is helpful, but not necessary. These are nice opportunities for those with mother's hours, or recently retired people who want to make a contribution to the lives of others and earn some income at the same time. Usually the relationships are mutually rewarding. These opportunities are also a good second source of income for those working part-time or working for themselves. 

Typically shifts range from three hours to four hourss-- often in the 10 am to 4 pm range). Often the jobs are two or three shifts weekly; occasionally they are five or more day. Some are Mon to Fri, some are weekend hours. Our jobs are primarily in Cambridge, Arlington, Belmont, Watertown, Newton, Lexington and adjacent towns. We have a small geographical territory - most of our jobs are within a 20 min drive of Belmont. We do not hire applicants who live beyond 30 miles of Belmont even if you are willing to drive. 

We look for caregivers who are bright, caring, mission driven and competent. It is helpful to have some experience (with family is OK) with elderly who suffer from some memory loss & be comfortable doing some homemaking duties (laundry, meal prep/clean-up, tidying up, etc). 


You need to have a car, a good driving record and be willing to drive the clients to outings and appointments. You need to be at least 23 years old to apply and we welcome inquiries from those in the age 23 to 70+ year old range. We primarily look for applicants with some higher education and prefer college graduates since many of our clients are well educated and were accomplished people in their careers; helpful to have some higher education in providing companionship to them. 

Beacon InHome is a private home care agency located in Belmont and is locally owned and operated by a geriatric social worker who is also a certified care manager. We have a small, caring and comfortable atmosphere as an agency and truly appreciate the caregivers who work for us.

Overview and Organizational Summary

Farm Aid is a national, not for profit organization that works year-round to promote a vibrant, just and resilient family farm system of agriculture in America. With music as our inspiration and farmers as our heroes, we envision a transformed America in which family farmers and citizens are active partners in a thriving food system that ensures farmers a fair living, justly nourishes people and communities, protects and sustains natural resources, and secures a prosperous future for all. 

Artists and Board members Willie Nelson, Neil Young and John Mellencamp organized the first Farm Aid concert in 1985 to raise awareness about the loss of family farms and to raise funds to keep farm families on the land. Dave Matthews joined the Farm Aid Board of Directors in 2001. Our annual music festival celebrates farmers, eaters and music coming together for change. Since 1985, Farm Aid has raised over $57 million to support programs that help farmers thrive, expand the reach of the Good Food Movement, take action to change the dominant system of industrial agriculture, and promote food from family farms.

•	Amplify the voice of family farmers to bring attention to the challenges they face and the benefits they bring;

•	Celebrate family farmers, good food and the culture of agriculture, in which we all can participate;

•	Invest talent, time and money in efforts that effect positive change in the farm and food system.

Overview and Organizational Summary
Farm Aid is a national, not for profit organization that works year-round to promote a vibrant, just and resilient family farm system of agriculture in America. With music as our inspiration and farmers as our heroes, we envision a transformed America in which family farmers and citizens are active partners in a thriving food system that ensures farmers a fair living, justly nourishes people and communities, protects and sustains natural resources, and secures a prosperous future for all. 

Artists and Board members Willie Nelson, Neil Young and John Mellencamp organized the first Farm Aid concert in 1985 to raise awareness about the loss of family farms and to raise funds to keep farm families on the land. Dave Matthews joined the Farm Aid Board of Directors in 2001. Our annual music festival celebrates farmers, eaters and music coming together for change. Since 1985, Farm Aid has raised over $57 million to support programs that help farmers thrive, expand the reach of the Good Food Movement, take action to change the dominant system of industrial agriculture, and promote food from family farms. 

Through direct service, grant making, community building, communications, and offering opportunities to engage meaningfully, Farm Aid works to:
•	Amplify the voice of family farmers to bring attention to the challenges they face and the benefits they bring;
•	Connect farmers to resources and opportunity, connect farmers to eaters, and in general connect people so that they may cultivate community and power;
•	Celebrate family farmers, good food and the culture of agriculture, in which we all can participate; 
•	Empower farmers and eaters to participate in a democratic, just and sustainable farm and food system; and
•	Invest talent, time and money in efforts that effect positive change in the farm and food system.

Farm Aid is seeking a Farmer Services Network Manager to support its mission and goals to help farmers thrive by advancing the capacity and coordination of farm advocates and farm service providers nationwide. 

Farm Aid recognizes that people gain skills through a variety of professional, personal, educational, and volunteer experiences.
